## About

This is my capstone project for the September 2022 MIT xPro Full Stack with MERN Coding Program: Women's Cohort. This Full Stack Better Bank application was created in React Redux using Node and Express to interact with a MongoDB Atlas database modeled using Mongoose, authentication through JWT. I am currently working on my application presentations that I will add on YouTube and link in the footer when available.

## Technologies and Skills Used

<ul>
  <li> HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  <li> React, Redux, React Router
  <li> Node, Express, Axios
  <li> MongoDB, Mongoose
  <li> Bootstrap, Toastify, React Icons
  <li> JSON Web Tokens
  <li> Input validation and error handling.
</ul>

## How To Use

This app allows you to create a user and deposit, withdraw, view your balance, and view your user data. It has full authorization and authentication functionality so that users must create an account or login to view the banks funcitonality. Additional functionality I have aded is the Avatar image upload, creation of a random account number for new accounts, and for users to be able to delete their own accounts. Note that while data is persistent across user login/logouts, the Avatar images are not due to size in database. 

## Future Possibilities

-   [ ] Add admin functionality
-   [X] Allow users to delete account
-   [X] Create random account number for new accounts
-   [X] Upload Avatar for profile 
-   [ ] Add transfers to another user functionality
-   [ ] Add different account types (checking/saving)
